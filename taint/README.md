# TaintFox Internals

See Taint.h for a detailed description of the internal taint classes and their usage.

## Sources and Sinks

### Sources

    git grep TaintFox | grep -i source

In dom/base/nsLocation.cpp
* location.hash
* location.host
* location.hostname
* location.href
* location.origin
* location.pathname
* location.username
* location.password
* location.search

In dom/base/nsINode.cpp
* document.baseURI

In dom/base/nsHTMLDocument.cpp
* document.cookie

In dom/base/nsDocument.cpp
* document.referrer
* document.documentURI

In dom/base/nsGlobalWindow.cpp
* window.name

#### Partial taint flows
The following sinks are partial taint flows, which although not exploitable alone,
could be combined with other vulnerabilities. For example, the XHR response can
be exploited as part of a stored XSS attack.

In dom/xhr/XMLHttpRequestMainThread.cpp
* XMLHttpRequest.response(Text)

In dom/websocket/WebSocket.cpp
* WebSocket.MessageEvent.data (for a String payload)

In dom/base/PostMessageEvent.cpp
* window.postMessage

#### Input Elements
HTML Input elements are a user-controlled input and could be used to inject
code into the DOM. Not sure if this can be exploited remotely though.

In dom/html/HTMLInputElement.cpp
* input.value for input elements (e.g. text box)

#### Local Storage
The window.localStorage.getItem can be vulnerable to stored DOM XSS attacks.
The implementation is in three different places depending on which type of
storage is being used:

* dom/storage/LocalStorage.cpp
* dom/storage/PartitionedLocalStorage.cpp
* localstorage/LSObject.cpp

The LSObject.cpp is "next generation" storage, and can be switched on by
going to [](about:config) and looking for the ```dom.storage.next_gen``` option.

TODO: intercept the local storage call and add the taint information to storage
as well (e.g. via JSON?)


### Sinks

    git grep TaintFox | grep -i sink

In dom/base/Element.cpp
* Event handler
* .outerHTML

In dom/base/FragmentOrElement.cpp
* .innerHTML

In dom/base/nsLocation.cpp
* location.hash
* location.hostname
* location.href
* location.pathname
* location.port
* location.protocol
* location.username
* location.password
* location.search

In dom/html/nsHTMLDocument.cpp
* document.cookie
* document.write

In dom/base/nsGlobalWindow.cpp
* setInterval
* setTimeout

In js/src/builtin/Eval.cpp
* eval()

In js/src/jsfun.cpp
* new Function

#### Partial taint flows
The following sinks are partial taint flows, which although not exploitable alone,
could be combined with other vulnerabilities.

In dom/xhr/XMLHttpRequestMainThread.cpp
* XMLHttpRequest.open
* XMLHttpRequest.send

In dom/websocket/WebSocket.cpp
* WebSocket.send (for a String payload)

In dom/events/MessageEvent.cpp
* window.messageEvent

#### Local Storage
The window.localStorage.setItem is a potential sink. As with sources,
the implementation is in three different places depending on which type of
storage is being used:

* dom/storage/LocalStorage.cpp
* dom/storage/PartitionedLocalStorage.cpp
* localstorage/LSObject.cpp

## Modified string classes

This is a hopefully complete list of all the different string classes that where patched throughout the engine.

Spidermonkey

* JSString and all its subclasses (js/src/vm/String.h)
    - Inherit from TaintableString
* StringBuffer (js/src/vm/StringBuffer.h)
    - Inherits from TaintableString
* shadow::String (js/src/jsfriendapi.h)

XPCOM

* nsAString and nsACString (xpcom/string/nsTSubstring.h)
    - Inherits from TaintableString
* nsStringBuffer (xpcom/string/nsStringBuffer.h)
    - Inherits from TaintableString
* nsFakeStringBuffer (xpcom/ds/nsStaticAtom.h)
* nsTSubstringTuple (xpcom/string/nsTSubstringTuple.h)
    - Just added taint() to compute the combined taint information

Note: The frozen string API is not taint aware, only the internal API.

Gecko

* FakeString (dom/bindings/BindingUtils.h)
    - Inherits from TaintableString
* nsTextFragment (dom/base/nsTextFragment.h)
    - Inherits from TaintableString
